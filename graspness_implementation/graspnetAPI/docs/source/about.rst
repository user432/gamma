GraspNet is an open project for general object grasping that is continuously enriched. Currently we release GraspNet-1Billion, a large-scale benchmark for general object grasping, as well as other related areas (e.g. 6D pose estimation, unseen object segmentation, etc.). graspnetAPI is a Python API that assists in loading, parsing and visualizing the annotations in GraspNet. Please visit graspnet website_ for more information on GraspNet, including for the data, paper, and tutorials. The exact format of the annotations is also described on the GraspNet website. In addition to this API, please download both the GraspNet images and annotations in order to run the demo.
